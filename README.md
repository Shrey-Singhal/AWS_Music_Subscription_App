# AWS Music Subscription Service

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a simple online music subscription application utilizing a robust stack of AWS services, including EC2, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. The application is designed to be hosted on a free-tier EC2 instance using Ubuntu Server and managed through an Apache2 web server environment. It features a dynamic web interface accessible via standard HTTP or HTTPS protocols that allows users to interact with the service directly through their browser.

## Screenshots of application
I cannot provide a direct link to my EC2 instance as I used my AWS educational account for this application. So, I have included screenshots of the application.
